Please answer the below core-java Questions:

What is programing language?
A. A programming language is a computer language that is
used by programmers (developers) to communicate with computers.
It is a set of instructions written in any specific language
to perform a specific task.




What jdk contains or composed of and define each components?
A. The JDK contains a private Java Virtual Machine (JVM) and
a few other resources such as an interpreter/loader (Java),
a compiler (javac), an archiver (jar), a documentation
generator (Javadoc) etc. to complete the development of a Java
Application.





What is IDE?
A. An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software
application that helps programmers develop software code
efficiently.



What are the IDEs available in the market to support java?
A. Available IDEs in the market are
Visual Studio.
IntelliJ IDEA.
Eclipse.
Amazon Corretto.
Xcode.
AWS Cloud9.
NetBeans.
Oracle JDeveloper.



Explain the entire java life cycle.
what is class?
A. A class is a template used to create objects and to define
object data types and methods. Classes are categories, and
objects are items within each category.


What is object?
A. An object is an instance of a class. A class is a template
or blueprint from which objects are created. So, an object is
the instance(result) of a class.


What is the entry point of an application?
A. In Java programs, the point from where the program starts
its execution or simply the entry point of Java programs is
the main() method.


Why main is static?
A. Java main() method is always static, so that compiler can
call it without the creation of an object or before the
creation of an object of the class. In any Java program,
the main() method is the starting point from where compiler
starts program execution. So, the compiler needs to call the
main() method.


Which class is the superclass of all classes?
A. The Object class, which is stored in the java. lang package,
is the ultimate superclass of all Java classes.


What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. The main difference between PATH and CLASSPATH is that Path
is set for java tools in java programs like java and javac,
which are used to compile your code. Whereas CLASSPATH is used
by System or Application class loader to locate and load
compile Java bytecodes stored in the . class file.


What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. the main difference between an interface and an abstract
class is that an interface cannot have state, whereas the
abstract class can have state with instance variables.


Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No, we can't create an object of an abstract class.
But we can create a reference variable of an abstract class.
The reference variable is used to refer to the objects of
derived classes.


what is Access Specifier?
A. An access specifier is a defining code element that can
determine which elements of a program are allowed to access
a specific variable or other piece of data.


What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. The main ideas behind Java's Object-Oriented Programming,
OOP concepts include abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance
and polymorphism. Basically, Java OOP concepts let us create
working methods and variables, then re-use all or part of
them without compromising security.


What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. A package in Java is used to group related classes.
Think of it as a folder in a file directory. The Java compiler
automatically imports two entire packages for each source
file: the java. lang package and the current package.


What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. An API is an interface that software developers use to
programmatically interact with software components or
resources outside of their own code. We used public and
privet API sp far.


Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. Java doesn't support multiple inheritances in classes
because it can lead to diamond problem and rather than
providing some complex way to solve it, there are better
ways through which we can achieve the same result as multiple
inheritances.


What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class
have the same method name but different parameters.
Overriding occurs when two methods have the same method name
and parameters. One of the methods is in the parent class,
and the other is in the child class.


Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. An exception object is an instance of an exception class.
It gets created and handed to the Java runtime when an
exceptional event occurred that disrupted the normal flow of
the application. This is called “to throw an exception”
because in Java you use the keyword “throw” to hand the
exception to the runtime.


What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. In Java, static keyword is mainly used for memory
management. It can be used with variables, methods, blocks
and nested classes. It is a keyword which is used to share
the same variable or method of a given class. Basically,
static is used for a constant variable or a method that is
same for every instance of a class.


What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. The final keyword is a non-access modifier used for
classes, attributes and methods, which makes them
non-changeable (impossible to inherit or override).
The final keyword is useful when you want a variable to
always store the same value.


What is final, finally and finalize?
A. Final is a keyword and is used as access modifier in Java.
Finally is a block in Java used for Exception Handling.
Finalize is a method in Java used for Garbage Collection.
Application. Final in Java is used with variables, methods,
and classes to set access permissions.


What is a constructor ?
A. A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to
initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object
of a class is created.


Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. A class can have multiple constructors that assign the fields in
different ways. Sometimes it's beneficial to specify every
aspect of an object's data by assigning parameters to the
fields, but other times it might be appropriate to define
only one or a few.


If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. If a class does not explicitly declare any, the Java
compiler automatically provides a no-argument constructor,
called the default constructor.


What is "this" keyword in java ?
A. The this keyword refers to the current object in a method
or constructor. The most common use of the this keyword is
to eliminate the confusion between class attributes and
parameters with the same name.


What is "super" keyword in java? How many possible way can you use?
A. The super keyword refers to superclass (parent) objects.
It is used to call superclass methods, and to access the
superclass constructor. The most common use of the super
keyword is to eliminate the confusion between superclasses
and subclasses that have methods with the same name.


What is JVM stand for ?
A. Java Virtual Machine.


Is JVM platform independent?
A. JVM is undoubtedly platform-independent.


What version of java are you using?
A. JAVA 11.


What is JAR stand for ?
A. JAR stands for Java Archive.


What is the difference between JDK and JVM?
A. The JVM is an abbreviation for Java Virtual Machine.
The JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development
kit that develops applications in Java.


What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JRE identifies all the helpful class libraries needed for
execution, while JVM is a subclass of JRE that decodes the
bytecode into machine language and other minor tasks.


What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile time is the period when the programming code is
converted to the machine code. Runtime is the period of
time when a program is running and generally occurs after
compile time.


What is heap?
A. The Java heap is the area of memory used to store objects
instantiated by applications running on the JVM. When the
JVM is started, heap memory is created and any objects in
the heap can be shared between threads as long as the
application is running.


How java manage it's memory?
A. In Java, memory management is the process of allocation
and de-allocation of objects, called Memory management.
Java does memory management automatically. Java uses an
automatic memory management system called a garbage collector.


What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?
A. String is immutable whereas StringBuffer and
StringBuilder are mutable classes. StringBuffer is
thread-safe and synchronized whereas StringBuilder is not.
That's why StringBuilder is faster than StringBuffer.
String concatenation operator (+) internally uses
StringBuffer or StringBuilder class.


What is Singleton class?
A. In Java, Singleton class is a class that controls the
object creation. It means the singleton class allows us to
create a single object of the class, at a time. It is usually
used to control access to resources, such as database
connections or sockets.


What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. Serialization in Java allows us to convert an Object to
stream that we can send over the network or save it as file
or store in DB for later usage. Deserialization is the
process of converting Object stream to actual Java Object
to be used in our program.


when to use transient variable in java?
A. Transient in Java is used to indicate that a field should
not be part of the serialization process.


Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. The difference between while and do while loop is that in
the while loop the condition is checked prior to executing
any statements whereas in the case of do while loop,
statements are run at least once, and then the condition
is verified.


What is Enum?
A. An enum type is a special data type that enables for a
variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable
must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined
for it.


What is Iterator?
A. An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through
collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an
"iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for
looping.


Which one will take more memory, an int or Integer?
A. As already mentioned int is a primitive data type and
takes 32 bits(4 bytes) to store. On other hand Integer
is an object which takes 128 bits (16 bytes) to store its
int value.


Why is String Immutable in Java?
A. The String is immutable in Java because of the security,
synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading.


What is constructor chaining in Java?
A. Constructor chaining is the process of calling one
constructor from another constructor with respect to
current object.


The difference between Serial and Parallel Garbage Collector?
A. The primary difference between the serial and parallel
collectors is that the parallel collector has multiple
threads that are used to speed up garbage collection.


What is JIT stands for?
A. JIT stand for  just-in-time.


Explain Java Heap space and Garbage collection?
A. Java objects reside in an area called the heap. The heap
is created when the JVM starts up and may increase or
decrease in size while the application runs. When the heap
becomes full, garbage is collected. During the garbage
collection objects that are no longer used are cleared, thus
making space for new objects.


Can you guarantee the garbage collection process?
A. There is no guarantee that any of the methods will run
Garbage Collector.


What is the difference between stack and heap in Java?
A. Java Heap Space is used throughout the application, but
Stack is only used for the method — or methods — currently
running.


What is reflection in java and why is it useful?
A. Reflection is a feature in the Java programming language.
It allows an executing Java program to examine or
"introspect" upon itself, and manipulate internal properties
of the program.


what is multithreading in java?
A. In Java, Multithreading refers to a process of executing
two or more threads simultaneously for maximum utilization
of the CPU. A thread in Java is a lightweight process
requiring fewer resources to create and share the process
resources.


What is the use of synchronization in Java?
A. Synchronization forms the basis of the execution of
multiple threads asynchronously in a multithreaded
application.


What is Framework?
A. Java frameworks are bodies of reusable pre-written code acting
as templates that developers can use to create applications
by filling in custom code as needed.


What are the testing Framework available in java?
A. Available testing Frameworks are
Selenium
JUnit
TestNG
SerenityBDD
Mockito


Difference between jUnit and testNG?
A. JUnit is a framework that is open-source and may be used
to write and trigger tests. TestNG is a Java-based framework
that provides an improved way to run tests.


What are the dependencies for this project?
A. Dependencies are
Finish-to-start
Finish-to-finish dependency
Start-to-start dependency
Start-to-finish dependencies


what is dependency injection in java?
A. Dependency Injection in Java is a way to achieve
Inversion of control in our application by moving
objects binding from compile time to runtime.


What is static binding and dynamic binding?
A. Dynamic binding or late binding is the mechanism a computer
program waits until runtime to bind the name of a method
called to an actual subroutine.
The binding which can be resolved at compile time by
compiler is known as static or early binding.
